**In this project We will use Spark with Python to do an amazing stuff. We have used spark streaming to count the total number of status code in the access log**.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark first**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark**?<br></br>

Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.<br></br>

**What is Spark Streaming**?<br></br>
Spark Streaming is the previous generation of Spark‚Äôs streaming engine. There are no longer updates to Spark Streaming and it‚Äôs a legacy project. There is a newer and easier to use streaming engine in Spark called Structured Streaming. You should use Spark Structured Streaming for your streaming applications and pipelines.<br></br>

Spark SQL includes a cost-based optimizer, columnar storage and code generation to make queries fast. At the same time, it scales to thousands of nodes and multi hour queries using the Spark engine, which provides full mid-query fault tolerance. Don't worry about using a different engine for historical data.<br></br>


**What is Breadth First Search**?<br></br>
Breadth-First Search Algorithm or BFS is the most widely utilized method. BFS is a graph traversal approach in which you start at a source node and layer by layer through the graph, analyzing the nodes directly related to the source node. Then, in BFS traversal, you must move on to the next-level neighbor nodes.<br></br>

**Important Note: Go through the Marvel+Graph file before jumping to the code.**
